# Population Structure of Porcine in Thailand, Vietnam, and USA

The SNP data set came from 676 swine samples of 21 breeds. The data were collected from a Porcine Colonization of the Americas data set [1] and two data sets of pigs raised in Thailand [2], and Vietnam [3]. All data were put through a data cleansing step. However, there were still some missing values. Those were estimated by a single imputation method. The estimated values were modes of the three datasets that made up our entire dataset. Each sample contains 10,210 SNPs.

The details of each class are shown in the following table.
